Kernel build needs to be executed using the following 4 steps:
1) Copy /boot/config-KERNEL_VERSION to .config in the kernel source directory.
2) Run make allmodconfig (modular support for any new kernel features that dont exist in our older kernel config)
3) make rpm
4) mv /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64 into our docker volume and spin down the container
